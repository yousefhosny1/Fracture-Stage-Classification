# Fracture-Stage-Classification
Classification of Fracture Stages in Oil &amp; Gas drilling operations

* Analyzed and feature engineered the Dataset to be fed to different classification Models
* Built and Tuned SVM, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost Machine Learning models to classify Fracture Stages in oil & gas drilling operations
* Determined the best performing model (SVM) by running each model on 10-Fold cross validations and comparing the average F1-Score for each model
* Achieved an F1-Score of 0.94 on the Support Vector Machine model
